## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.11+
*   Poetry (recommended package manager)
*   PostgreSQL (local or remote database)
*   Ollama (for LLM functionality)
*   Docker (for hosting your own database)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[your_username]/JobTracker.git
    cd JobTracker
    ```

2.  Install dependencies using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation):

    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

3.  Set up your PostgreSQL database and create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

    ```
    POSTGRES_USER=your_username
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_password
    POSTGRES_DB=your_database_name
    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_PORT=5432
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://${POSTGRES_USER}:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@${DB_HOST}:${DB_PORT}/${POSTGRES_DB}"
    ```

4. Ensure Ollama is running and accessible.

5. Ensure you have Docker installed and running.

### Usage

To add a new job entry:

1.  Turn on your database with Docker Compose:
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d --build
    ```
    This command will build and start the database container in detached mode.

2.  Copy the job description to your clipboard.

3.  Run the JobTracker script:

    ```bash
    poetry run python job_tracker/main.py --schema init.sql
    ```
    or if you installed `poetry shell` you can use it to run as: 
    ```bash
    python job_tracker/main.py --schema init.sql
    ```

4.  Follow the interactive prompts to confirm the extracted information and add the job to your database.

## Database Schema

You can incoprate your own schemas, but you will need to edit the `template` for the langchain, so that it can properly create the desired json output you want.

## License

## Example

To get started, navigate to the job posting on the website and copy the application details. 
Once you run the script, it will automatically generate this information as a new entry. 
You can then review and verify the details before adding them to the database.
